# Goals is to achieve the dynamic flow of components

meaning lest say we 4 component

A,B,C,D

now in flow i need 

1. A->B->C->D

meaning entry componnent is A after a next b need to be mounted

next c and So on




2. second flow 

 B->C->D->A
 
 
 
3.third flow 

C->D->B->A


we can configure this the way we need

We can go  with central data storage like Redux or Context api
